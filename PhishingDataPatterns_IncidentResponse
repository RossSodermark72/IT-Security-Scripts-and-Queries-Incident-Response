# This is documentation for Phishing Data Patterns to aid in response to SCAM and SPAM emails with details for what action is needed 

# Threat Actor Countries found: 
Nigeria, Laos, Italy, Brazil, Japan, Hong Kong, Mexico, U.K., Indonesia, Netherlands, India, Korea, 

# Common Red Flags:
- Third Party Compromised Accounts sending SCAM emails
- Compromised Microsoft Tenants
- One of the core three (DKIM, DMARC, or SPF) is either ignored, perm error, or failed
- Brand Impersonation: Most common SCAM. SCAMs include: Sharepoint, OneDrive, Paypal, DocuSign, Venmo, Amazon, Norton, random fake business to attempt to trick users in thinking the email coresspondence is legit when it is not (often a backstory with these with a spoof with someon in our JF company). 
- Fake Invoices
- Suspicious PDFs
- GrayMail

# What to Check First:
- Always check the header first, valuable information to determine if it is legit or not. (I have used Microsfot Header Analyzer). 
- Look for email format. Sometimes phish emails have unecessary spaces or extra characters. 
- Weird wording for a professional email. Often there are captial letters, and seems to hint at compelting a task "quickly." Ambigious wording. Examples include: "Greetings of the day," "URGENT", "THIS NEEDS TO BE COMPLETED NOW" 


# Actions Required: 
- When Phish is detected and determined to be phish, add sender to blocked list in Mimecast
- If the Phsh is determined to be a SCAM, block the sender and perform threat remediation in either 365 Defender or Mimecast. (You have to use both sometimes when removing phish emails sent to an email group).
